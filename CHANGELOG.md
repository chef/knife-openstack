# BACKLOG/ISSUES #
This is a list of missing(?) features and open questions currently under development consideration:

* Basic availability zones support (Jarek Zmudzinski) NEED TESTING ACCESS FOR AVAILABILITY ZONES
* purge only works when names match up with clients
* `knife openstack floating list|associate|release NODE` with --floating-ip-pool also
* KNIFE-229 Allow specifying the name of the pool when using floating IPs
* attempt to allocate a floating ipaddress if none if free, currently missing in Fog
* KNIFE-76 take either the flavor ID or the flavor name
* take either the image ID or the image name (similar for KNIFE-76)
* KNIFE-86 server create with expired password hangs
* KNIFE-231 added ability to specify arbitrary network ID
* assumption of only single floating IP (and fog uses the last as the public_ip_address)
* probably other places public network is assumed that could cause issues
* fog is putting the original public IP address into the private_ip_address method when you get a floating_ip, this is wrong. Remove KNIFE-248 code once fixed.
